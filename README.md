# Cassowary 6502

This repository stands for `cassowary-6502` - a simple **C** library created for a small breadboard computer project
based on a microprocessor **W65C02** as described by [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/6502) on his page.

This is a work in progress, please look at the release page for any news.

## What's included

This project would include some C library files that would help to display data on
Ben Eater's 6502 computer. 

- Display text easily on the LCD
- Read text from LCD
- Move LCD cursor at any point

In future I plan to add more extended functionality, maybe to support a video card 
created by Ben Eater in his other videos.
